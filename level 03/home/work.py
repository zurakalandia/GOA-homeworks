# to create a variable we need to give it : a name, value, and a symbol to connect them (=)

# for example we give the variable a name - 'money'
# then we give it a value - '75000'
# and finally, connect it with (=)

# example:

money = (75000)  # variable



num1 = (90)
num2 = (75)
num3 = (4)

print(num1 + num2 + num3)



x = (5)
y = ('ab')

print(x * y)



length = (20)
width = (10)

print(length * 2 + width * 2)
