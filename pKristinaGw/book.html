      <h1>THE BEST FULLYRAW<br>VEGAN BOOK</h1>
      <p>
        Kristina Carrillo-Bucaram, YouTube sensation and founder of FullyRaw, transformed her health with a 100 percent raw vegan lifestyle—and you can too. Weight loss, energy, and the glow of better health are all benefits of eating fresh, whole, unrefined plant-based foods in their natural state—without cooking.

    "No more dialysis. No more chemotherapy. No more medicine. This book has changed my life forever. Kristina's lifestyle is not a fad. Eating real fruits and vegetables is something that we should be doing but oh, how we forget to do something as simple as that. I stopped making excuses and started picking up the right things to eat. As a first-generation Cambodian American, my culture's cuisine is riddled with highly salted and fermented (rotten) food. I don't eat these foods anymore, but that's alright. In fact, my family has started to adopt some of my eating habits as most of our family all take some form of high blood pressure medicine."

    "I LOVE THIS BOOK! I started my transition to vegetarian in 2012, vegan in 2014 and attempted Raw in 2015. For the month I was able to eat RAW, it was the healthiest I have ever felt!"

    Simple and truly raw.
She brings the concept of eating raw to being simple and truly raw. I have many books on raw and have been high raw for years. I did find her book refreshing and inspiring. She really does make eating raw simple and possible and was a great reminder to me to bring that approach back into my life.
